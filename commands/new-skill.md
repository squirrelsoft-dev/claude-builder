# Create New Skill

Use the skill-generator skill to create a new Claude Code Skill.

Gather information from the user about:
- What the skill should do (purpose/domain)
- When it should activate (optional - can infer from purpose)
- What tools it needs (optional - can infer from purpose)
- Where to create it (project vs user - can auto-detect)

Use intelligent defaults to minimize prompting. Create the skill with proper YAML frontmatter, effective description, and clear system prompt.

After creation, show the user what was created and suggest how to test it.
